0. Node ID Extraction: Run node_id_extraction.py to extract all relevant node ids per image. Saved into txt files (or node_id_extraction_intersections.py for intersections only).

1. Data Annotation: Run gt_mask_annotate.py to extract segmentation masks for satellite images based on OSM data

2. Dataset Creation: Run the following to extract image patches for both satellite and mask .tif files:
    . build_dataset.sh
(You will likely run this twice for both the satellite image directory and the mask directory)

3. Organize Dataset: Run data_organize.py to format the data as the following:
    - dataset_dir
        - nodeid_dir
            - nodeid_mask.png 
            - nodeid_sat.jpg

4. Dataset Split: Run split_dataset.py to split the dataset_dir into training, testing, and validation samples. 
You will now have a new directory in the following format:
    - dataset_dir
        - train_dir
        - test_dir
        - val_dir

5. Training the Transformer: Run sseg_transformer.py to begin the training and evaluation process of the model.
