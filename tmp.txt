Accessible navigation for wheelchair users remains a
significant challenge due to obstacles such as uneven sidewalks,
steep inclines, and the lack of access ramps. Existing routing
systems primarily focus on minimizing travel time or distance,
often failing to consider mobility constraints. This paper presents
MyPath, an end-to-end accessible navigation system that inte-
grates user-reported data, machine learning, and programmatic
analysis to optimize routing for wheelchair users. Additionally,
MyPath provides detailed, step-by-step navigation instructions.
By unifying these elements within a mobile application, My-
Path provides a real-time, personalized, and scalable solution
for accessible routing. Our contributions include (1) a novel
hybrid routing framework integrating real-world feedback and
algorithmic approach, (2) automated detection of environmental
barriers, and (3) Step by step detailed navigation. The proposed
system has broad implications for urban accessibility, smart
mobility, and inclusive navigation solutions
